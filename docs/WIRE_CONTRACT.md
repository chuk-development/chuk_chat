# CoWork wire contract: run state, replay cursor, completion

This file is the contract between the Flutter app and the Python executor for the
frames that carry run state, history replay and run completion. Three sessions work
on the executor and protocol at the same time. All of them must use the same frame
shapes. This file is the reference.

Status: the Python side (executor, host, state store) implements this contract.
The app (Dart) side codes to it; until the app sends `after_id` and `run_ack`, the
executor treats a replay as a full replay and a run as unseen. Both sides ignore
fields they do not know.

## Rules

- All frames travel inside the sealed CoWork frame, as today.
- The contract is additive. A receiver MUST ignore unknown fields. A sender MUST NOT
  remove or rename an existing field.
- `session_key` selects the thread on the executor. It equals the agent's thread key
  in the app (one session per agent).

## Outbound: app → executor

| type | fields | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `task` | `prompt`, `session_key`, `model`?, `provider`?, `reasoning_effort`?, `mcp_servers`?, `herenow`?, `debug`? | Existing. Field names are `model` and `provider` (NOT `model_id` / `provider_slug`). There is no `fast_mode` field; Fast mode is a model + `reasoning_effort` chosen by the app. |
| `stop` | `session_key` | Existing. |
| `replay` | `session_key`, `after_id`? (int, default 0) | `after_id` is NEW. Replay only the messages with `mid > after_id`. `0` replays the full history (fresh install). |
| `run_ack` | `run_id` | NEW. The app sends it after it rendered a live `done`. The host marks the run as seen (`runs.seen_at`), so a later replay does not flag it `while_away`, and it can skip a push notification. |
| `account_authentication` | `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `user_id`, `supabase_url`, `anon_key`, `expires_at`? (epoch seconds, NEW) | Existing. NEW rule: it can arrive again during a session (token rotation, re-provision). The executor MUST route it to the host as a re-provision and MUST NOT treat it as a task. The app sends it (a) once after pairing, (b) at once on Supabase `AuthChangeEvent.tokenRefreshed`, even while a task runs, (c) as the answer to a `reprovision_request`, (d) as the ack of an `account_session_rotated`. |

### Token freshness (bead cowork-c91)

The host must never run a task on a stale token. Three paths keep it fresh:

1. App → host, proactive: on every Supabase token refresh the app re-sends
   `account_authentication` with the new pair. The host swaps the tokens in place
   (no task-server rebuild).
2. Host → app, on demand: `{"type": "reprovision_request", "reason": "token_expired" | "refresh_failed"}`.
   The app answers with a fresh `account_authentication` (it refreshes first when
   the reason says the token expired).
3. Host → app, after the host refreshed on its own (no app attached): Supabase
   rotates the refresh token, so the app's copy is dead. The host sends
   `{"type": "account_session_rotated", "access_token", "refresh_token", "expires_at", "rotated_at"}`
   (pending, re-sent until acked). The app adopts it (`setSession(refresh_token)`),
   updates its stores, and acks with an `account_authentication` carrying the new
   pair. Idempotent: an app that already holds a newer token keeps its own and still
   acks.

### `mcp_servers` on `task` (extended, additive)

One entry per connector the user has configured, assembled by
`McpStore.forwardPayloads()` and read by `mcp_client.configs_from_entries()`.
The frozen example both sides assert against is
`app/test/fixtures/mcp_forward_payload.json`.

```json
{"name": "<connector name>", "url": "<https endpoint>", "auth": "oauth" | "appSession",
 "access_token": "<bearer>"?,
 "oauth": {"token_endpoint": "<url>", "client_id": "<id>", "client_secret": "<secret>"?,
           "refresh_token": "<token>", "expires_at": "<iso 8601>"?, "resource": "<url>"?,
           "scope": "<space separated>"?, "issuer": "<url>"?}?}
```

The `oauth` block is NEW. Everything else is unchanged, and a receiver that does
not know the block keeps working off `access_token` alone.

Who authenticates what:

- `auth: "oauth"` — the device ran the sign-in (browser + loopback redirect, see
  `lib/services/mcp/mcp_oauth.dart`). `access_token` is the bearer it holds; the
  app refreshes it before forwarding when it has already lapsed, so a running app
  always hands over a live one.
- `oauth` — present only when the record holds a `refresh_token` AND a
  `token_endpoint`. It is what lets the host outlive the app: with the app closed
  there is nobody to open a browser, so the executor mints its own access tokens
  from `refresh_token` at `token_endpoint` (RFC 6749, `client_secret` via HTTP
  Basic when the server issued one). A connector signed in by a build before P5
  has a bearer and no block; it works until that bearer dies, then the user signs
  in again.
- `auth: "appSession"` — no device token. The executor authenticates with its own
  account bearer.
- An API-key connector carries neither `auth` nor `access_token`: its credentials
  are already query parameters on `url`. Unchanged.

`expires_at` is informational — the host may treat the token as live until a `401`
— and it is the field to drop, together with `access_token` and
`oauth.refresh_token`, when hashing this list to decide whether an MCP manager has
to be rebuilt. A rotated token is not a changed connector.

### `mcp_credentials` (NEW, executor → app)

The return half of the forward payload above. It lives in this section because
the two shapes must not drift: an entry here uses exactly the field names of an
`mcp_servers` entry.

One frame per connector. Rotations are rare, so there is nothing to batch.

```json
{"type": "mcp_credentials", "session_key": "<key>",
 "id": "<device connector id>"?, "name": "<connector name>", "url": "<https endpoint>",
 "access_token": "<bearer>"?,
 "oauth": {"refresh_token": "<token>", "expires_at": "<iso 8601 UTC>"?,
           "token_endpoint": "<url>", "client_id": "<id>",
           "resource": "<url>"?, "scope": "<space separated>"?, "issuer": "<url>"?},
 "rotated_at": "<iso 8601>"}
```

The app also accepts the same entries under a `servers` array, so batching them
later needs no change on the app side. `session_key` and `rotated_at` are read by
nobody on the app side today — connectors are global, not per session — but they
are carried because the executor needs them.

Why it exists: the host mints its own access tokens from the refresh material
the device handed it. A provider that rotates refresh tokens (Google, Okta,
Auth0 with rotation on) issues a NEW one and kills the old one in the same
response — at which point the copy in the device's keychain is dead and only the
host knows the live one. Without this frame the connector works until the host
process ends and is then unrecoverable except by a fresh sign-in.

**When the executor sends it.** For every connector whose host-side
`(refresh_token, expires_at)` still differ from what the app last forwarded:
at the end of every task, before the `done` terminal, and on every replay or
reconnect. A new access token alone is NOT a trigger — the app can mint that
itself. There is no durable outbox and a result frame sent to a detached
controller is dropped, so the frame repeats until the app forwards the new token
back. **That forward is the acknowledgement**: once the two sides agree, nothing
more is sent.

**What the app does with it.** It updates the stored record for that connector
(secure storage, plus the encrypted Supabase mirror) with `refresh_token`,
`expires_at` and, when present, `access_token`. Applying it is idempotent — last
one wins, and a frame that changes nothing writes nothing.

**What the app does NOT do.** The device stays the authority on connector
identity. A frame never creates a connection, never re-points a `url` and never
changes the registered client. `client_secret` is never sent back: the host got
it from the device, so the device already has it.

Silently ignored, with no user-facing failure — a wrong frame must not cost a
working connector:

- an entry for a connector this device does not have,
- an entry with no `refresh_token` (there is nothing to rescue),
- an entry whose `oauth.client_id` differs from the stored one. That means the
  user signed in again, dynamic registration issued a new client, and this
  rotation is against a registration that no longer exists.

Matching is on `id` — the app's own connector id, which the app puts on the
outbound entry and the host echoes back unchanged. `name` is a display name and
two connectors may share one. A frame with no `id` falls back to `url` + `name`.

### `account_session_rotated` (NEW, host → app)

The mirror of `reprovision_request`. While a controller is attached the APP is
the token source and the host never spends the refresh token. With no controller
attached the host must keep working, so it refreshes via GoTrue itself — and
GoTrue rotates the refresh token, which kills the app's copy. This frame hands
the new pair to the app so both sides hold the same pair again, whoever refreshed.

```json
{"type": "account_session_rotated",
 "access_token": "<bearer>", "refresh_token": "<token>",
 "expires_at": <epoch seconds>?, "rotated_at": "<iso 8601>"}
```

- Sent as soon as a controller is attached after the rotation; while none is,
  it is kept pending and re-sent on the next connect until acknowledged.
- Ack = the app sends an `account_authentication` frame whose `refresh_token`
  equals the rotated one (its normal (re-)provision after adopting the pair).
  Idempotent: last one wins; a frame that changes nothing writes nothing.
- The app adopts the pair (`setSession`) and writes it to its pairing store, so
  a reinstall does not come back with the dead token. It never treats this as
  a login for a different user: `user_id` is not carried and must not change.

## Inbound: executor → app

Existing event types stay as they are: `delta`, `reasoning`, `tool`, `file`,
`subagent`, `user`, `done`, `error`, `debug_context`, `approval_request`, `room_*`,
`browser_*`. The changes below are additive.

### `browser_view` `started` (extended, additive)

```json
{"type": "browser_view", "status": "started", "message": "<text>", "password": "<vnc secret>"?}
```

`password` is optional: the per-view VNC secret the executor set on the sandbox
`x11vnc`. The app passes it to its RFB client; an old app ignores it.

### `run_state` (NEW)

Emitted first in every replay response.

```json
{"type": "run_state", "session_key": "<key>", "state": "running" | "idle",
 "run_id": "<uuid>"?, "started_at": <unix seconds>?, "prompt": "<text>"?}
```

- `running`: a run for this session is in flight on the host (it may have started
  before this app connected). The app shows "Working…" with the original prompt.
- `idle`: no run in flight.

### `mid` on replayed events (NEW field)

Every replayed `user`, `delta` and `tool` event carries the row id of the message
store: `"mid": <int>`. The app keeps the highest `mid` it saw per session as the
replay cursor and sends it back as `after_id`. Live events may carry `mid` later;
the app treats it as optional.

### `done` (extended)

```json
{"type": "done", "final_answer": "<text>"?, "reason": "<reason>", "iterations": <int>,
 "tokens_spent": <int>, "replay": true | false, "run_id": "<uuid>"?, "while_away": true | false}
```

Semantics, in this order:

1. `reason == "replay"`: the history-end marker. It closes a replay stream. The app
   renders nothing for it and ends replay mode. This is the existing behaviour and
   stays so old clients keep working.
2. `replay == true` and `reason != "replay"` (for example `"finished"`): a persisted
   run terminal replayed from the host. The app renders it as a real completion card.
   `while_away == true` means the run finished with no app attached; the app shows an
   "Answer ready" affordance.
3. `replay == false`: a live run ended, as today.

Persisted run terminals are replayed in message-id order, interleaved with the
messages of that run.

App-side helpers on `CoworkRelayDone`:

- `isHistoryEnd` = `reason == 'replay'`
- `isReplay` = `replay == true || reason == 'replay'` (kept for compatibility)
- `whileAway`, `runId`

## Host-side record (informative)

The executor keeps a `runs` table in the same SQLite file as the messages
(`run_id` PK, `session_id`, `session_key`, `prompt`, `state` running|finished|failed,
`reason`, `final_answer`, `iterations`, `tokens_spent`, `first_mid`, `last_mid`,
`started_at`, `finished_at`, `notified_at`, `seen_at`). `notified_at` is the dedup
key for notifications (set once, whichever channel fires first). `seen_at` is set by
`run_ack`: the app showed the live `done`. `while_away` in a replayed `done` is
`seen_at IS NULL`. On host start, rows left in `running` are set to
`failed` / `host_restarted`.

## Detachment rule (informative)

A run belongs to the host process, not to a socket. When the app disconnects the run
keeps going, the transcript keeps landing in the message store, and result frames
for an absent controller are dropped (not buffered). When the app reconnects it
re-binds the frame codec and requests `replay` with its cursor.

## Tool events and timestamps (beads cowork-b45, cowork-al2)

Proposed 2026-09-05 by session cowork-84. Additive. Python side: cowork-b5.
App side (relay client, ledger, replay loader): cowork-47. Rendering: cowork-84.

Python side IMPLEMENTED 2026-09-05 (session cowork-reasoning, uncommitted):
`cowork_agent.tool_events.tool_event_fields` is the one shape; the loop emits it
live through `AgentLoop(tool_event_observer=...)` (wired by the executor,
`_env_shim.on_run` no longer emits tool frames), `StateStore.replay_events`
rebuilds it from the rows, `StateStore.run_stamp_fields` stamps every `done`.
Two details beyond the text below: a live `tool` frame carries no `mid` (the
cursor moves on `done.last_mid`); a replayed call is matched to its result
row within its own turn, by `tool_call_id` first and by position otherwise,
so a model that reuses call ids across turns cannot cross-wire results.

### The problem

Today a live `tool` frame and a replayed `tool` frame come from two different
sources, so the app draws two different sets of cards for the same run:

| | live | replay |
|---|---|---|
| source | `_env_shim.on_run`: one frame per shell command `env.run_bash` executes | `StateStore.replay_events`: one frame per native tool call on a stored assistant row |
| which tools | only `run_command` — but ALSO the internal shell commands of `write_file`, `read_file`, `list_dir`, `run_python` (each shows as a `run_command` card with a `printf ... base64 -d` command line) | every native tool: `run_command`, `write_file`, `web_search`, MCP tools, `finish`, ... |
| `command` | the shell command line | the native arguments as one JSON string |
| `exit_code` | real | always `0` |
| `stdout` | real | the tool result text |
| failure | real | never |
| timestamps | none | none |

So the count, the names, the arguments and the status differ, and the app has
no time for any card. It stamps the time it folded the frame, which makes a
replayed round 0 seconds long ("Worked for 0s").

### One source: the native tool call

Live and replay both emit ONE `tool` frame per native tool call the model
made, after its result is known. The executor emits it from the loop's tool
dispatch, not from the environment hook. `_env_shim.on_run` emits no `tool`
frame any more (it may feed a future `command` frame for the full-log view;
not part of this change).

```json
{"type": "tool", "name": "<tool name>", "call_id": "<native call id>"?,
 "arguments": {"<key>": "<value>"},
 "command": "<string>"?,
 "result": "<tool result as text>",
 "exit_code": <int>?, "stdout": "<text>"?, "stderr": "<text>"?, "timed_out": <bool>?,
 "status": "completed" | "error",
 "started_at": <unix seconds>, "completed_at": <unix seconds>,
 "duration_ms": <int>?,
 "replay": <bool>, "mid": <int>?}
```

- `arguments` (NEW): the native arguments, as an object. When the model sent a
  string the loop could not parse, the string is sent as it is.
- `command` (kept for old apps): `arguments.command` for `run_command`,
  `arguments.code` for `run_python`. Absent for other tools. Never a JSON blob.
- `result` (NEW): the tool result as one text, the same text the model got
  (`_as_text(content)` of the stored `tool` row).
- `exit_code`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `timed_out`: projected from the result when
  the result is a dict with these keys (`run_command`, `run_python`). Absent
  otherwise. An old app reads them as before.
- `status` (NEW): `error` when `exit_code != 0`, or `timed_out`, or the result
  dict has `error`, or the result dict has `ok: false`, or the dispatch raised.
  Else `completed`.
- `started_at` / `completed_at` (NEW, unix seconds, float): live, the clock
  before and after the dispatch. Replay, `created_at` of the assistant row
  (the call) and `created_at` of the matching `tool` row (the result).
- `duration_ms`: `completed_at - started_at`, for old apps that read only this.

Not covered here: `subagent`, `file` and `approval_request` frames. Their
persistence and replay is the section "Persisted subagent / file / approval
events" below (bead cowork-266); the contract above does not change them.

### Run timestamps on `done`

`done` gets four more fields, on the live terminal and on a replayed run
terminal alike (all from the `runs` row: the executor writes `_record_run`
before it sends the terminal):

```json
{"type": "done", ..., "started_at": <unix seconds>, "finished_at": <unix seconds>,
 "first_mid": <int>, "last_mid": <int>}
```

- `started_at` / `finished_at`: the run's clock on the host. The app shows
  `finished_at - started_at` as "Worked for", live and replayed alike.
- `first_mid` / `last_mid`: the message rows of this run. On a LIVE `done` the
  app moves its replay cursor to `last_mid`. Without that, the next replay
  (reconnect, host restart) sends the live run's rows again above the old
  cursor, and the app appends them behind the copy it already drew — the
  duplicate turn with differently drawn tool cards.

`run_state.started_at` is unchanged.

### What the app does with it

- `ToolCall.startedAt` / `completedAt` come from `started_at` /
  `completed_at`. One mapping function, used by the live path (ledger) and
  the replay path (loader); a test asserts that the same frame gives the same
  `ToolCall` (minus id) on both paths.
- `ToolCall.arguments` is the `arguments` object (plus `exit_code` when
  present). `result` is `result`, else `stdout` + `stderr` as today.
- A replayed answer row gets `generationMs` from the run terminal. It gets NO
  `startedAt`: the imported persistence handler re-stamps the newest row from
  `startedAt` at every save, and a host time there would grow the number to
  the age of the thread.
- A live answer row keeps chuk's own measurement (`startedAt` on the
  placeholder, `generationMs` at save). It is within one second of the host
  number.

before it sends the terminal):

```json
{"type": "done", ..., "started_at": <unix seconds>, "finished_at": <unix seconds>,
 "first_mid": <int>, "last_mid": <int>}
```

- `started_at` / `finished_at`: the run's clock on the host. The app shows
  `finished_at - started_at` as "Worked for", live and replayed alike.
- `first_mid` / `last_mid`: the message rows of this run. On a LIVE `done` the
  app moves its replay cursor to `last_mid`. Without that, the next replay
  (reconnect, host restart) sends the live run's rows again above the old
